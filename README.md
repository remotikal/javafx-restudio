# ReStudio-JavaFX
This JavaFX application provides a simple code editor with basic functionality to save and open files. It allows users to write, edit, and save code snippets in various programming languages.

## Features

- **Code Editing**: The application provides a TextArea component where users can write and edit code. The code area is customizable with a monospaced font and a dark background, giving it a code editor-like appearance.

- **Save File**: Clicking the "Save" button prompts the user to select a location to save the code. The application then writes the content of the code area to the selected file.

- **Open File**: Clicking the "Open" button allows the user to choose a file from their local system. The application reads the selected file and displays its content in the code area.

- **About Us**: Clicking the "About Us" button opens a separate window that displays information about the program and its creator.

## Supported File Extensions

The code editor supports the following file extensions: `.c`, `.cdart`, `.java`, `.html`, and `.js`. These file extensions determine the syntax highlighting and code formatting for a better editing experience.

## Getting Started

To run the code editor, ensure you have Java and JavaFX installed on your system. Execute the `CodeEditor.java` file, and the application window will open, ready for code editing.
